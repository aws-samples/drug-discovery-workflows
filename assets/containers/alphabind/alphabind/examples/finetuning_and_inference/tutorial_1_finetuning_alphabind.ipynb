    "# Finetuning AlphaBind to your data and running inference\n",
    "**2024-10-21**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows a user how to fine-tune Alphabind to their own specific PPI data. We will cover the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preparing your data to be consumed by AlphaBind\n",
    "2. Fine-tuning Alphabind to customize it to your protein-protein interaction (PPI) data\n",
    "3. Running inference to predict on a new dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Prepare your data for AlphaBind\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to fine-tune the AlphaBind pre-trained model checkpoint, you will need to convert your dataset into something that the model's inputs expect. AlphaBind predictions are based on the AlphaSeq assay. You must always format your data in the \"YM\" or \"YeastMating\" format. This requires 3 critical columns in your dataset:\n",
    "- `sequence_a`: The peptide sequence of one of the proteins in a PPI\n",
    "- `sequence_alpha`: The peptide sequence of the second protein in a PPI\n",
    "- `Kd`: A measurement or proxy measurement for binding affinity. NOTE: The AlphaBind pre-trained model was trained on data expressed as log10-Kd. Your data does not necessarily need to be in the same range or scale, however we strongly recommend that it should follow the same sign convention (i.e. large negative values represent strong binders, and large positive values represent weak binders).\n",
    "\n",
    "The above columns are case-sensitive and mandatory. While you do not need explicit AlphaSeq assay data to use AlphaBind, you need to derive the analogs to each of these columns in your native dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NOTE: `sequence_a` and `sequence_alpha` assignment convention\n",
    "\n",
    "When assigning sequences, we recommend choosing a consistent convention for assigning functional classes of proteins to `sequence_a` vs. `sequence_alpha`. For example, in a dataset of antibody-antigen interactions, provide sequences for all antibodies and their variants in `sequence_a` only, and provide all antigens and their respective variants in `sequence_alpha` only.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: If you intend to run optimization to design your own sequences later, ensure the protein that you would want modifications to is `sequence_a`. For example, if you want to generate diverse antibodies against a known target, your `sequence_a` would be the antibodies and your `sequence_alpha` would be the target antigen sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NOTE: Max sequence length\n",
    "\n",
    "The AlphaBind model pre-trained checkpoint supports a max combined sequence length (`sequence_a` and `sequence_alpha`) of 600 amino acids (AA). Ensure that the combined length of each PPI pair in your dataset is within this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Pre-processing the data from _Mason et al._\n",
    "\n",
    "For an illustrative example, We will use an example from [Mason et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-021-00699-9). Here, we will transform the data into something that looks YM-like, even though the original experimental assay is not AlphaSeq."

    "The authors of the paper generated 3 libraries of Trastuzumab variants in the IgG format with mutations in the CDRH3 region. The starting sequence was a non-binding variant. Libraries were then transfected into mammalian cells and transfected into FACS. One round of enrichment occurred, to identify an Antigen binding (Ag+) and non-binding (Ag-) population. Another round of enrichment on the Ag+ population allowed further refinement of stronger binders (Ag+2) population. Thus, three binding populations are defined: Ag+2, Ag+, and Ag-.\n",
