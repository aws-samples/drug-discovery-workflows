The following contains AlphaBind tutorials. The goal of these tutorials is to build familiarity with how to take your own protein-protein (PPI) interaction data, and train models using Alphabind.

- [Tutorial 1: Fine-tuning and Inference](finetuning_and_inference/tutorial_1_finetuning_alphabind.ipynb): Tutorial covering how to generate your own fine-tuned model, and run predictions on your PPIs.
- [Tutorial 2: Optimization](optimization/tutorial_2_optimization_alphabind.ipynb): Instructions to design your own sequences for a given property of interest.
