# Biomolecule structure prediction with Boltz-1

## Summary

From https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz:

>Boltz-1 is the state-of-the-art open-source model to predict biomolecular structures containing combinations of proteins, RNA, DNA, and other molecules. It also supports modified residues, covalent ligands and glycans, as well as conditioning the prediction on specified interaction pockets or contacts.
