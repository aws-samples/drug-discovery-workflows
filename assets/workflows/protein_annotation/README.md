# Predict Protein Functional Annotations with ESM3

## Summary

This example workflow demonstrates how to use the ESM3 generative model to predict protein function.

## Data

Before running this workflow, you must first upload a valid set of model weigghts and supporting data as a .tar.gz file into an S3 bucket in your account. You then provide the S3 URL of this archive when creating new runs.
